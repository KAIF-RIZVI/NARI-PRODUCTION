# Naari - An Initiative for Financial Inclusion of Women

*Naari* is a fintech web application built on cutting-edge technology to promote and empower women in the fields of finance and entrepreneurship. This platform integrates government APIs, Google APIs, and a chatbot to provide a seamless and functional user experience.

## About The Project

At Naari, our mission is to enhance the financial independence of women and integrate them into mainstream financial matters. We believe that for India to become a world leader in the 21st century, the equal participation of women is essential. The key to this upliftment lies in financial literacy.

Our solution is a comprehensive portal uniquely designed for women. It not just helps them understand the basic workflow of legal documents and banking solutions, but also provides unique features like the "Gullak" scheme for investment, an e-market for entrepreneurs, a job portal, and educational resources.

## Unboxing Web App Features

This platform is packed with services designed to empower users at every step of their financial journey.

### Key Services

*   *Gullak:* A new and secure digital form of investment inspired by traditional Self-Help Groups (SHGs). Gullak acts as a central account where women can pool money, which is then invested in the market to earn a profit. Users can redeem their principal amount plus their share of the profit at any time.

*   *Hard Cash To Digital Cash:* This feature allows users to convert physical cash into digital currency. Using a machine learning algorithm and geolocation, a user can find a registered "DigiSender" (a local shopkeeper) nearby. The shopkeeper verifies the cash, and the equivalent digital amount is instantly transferred to the woman's account.

*   *E-Market:* An online marketplace that facilitates the buying and selling of regional and local goods like food items, handicrafts, and more. This service empowers women entrepreneurs and Self-Help Groups to sell their products beyond the boundaries of a physical marketplace.

*   *Open a Bank Account:* Simplifies the process of opening a bank account. Users can connect with bank representatives via video or voice call and securely share their details to open an account without needing to visit a branch.

*   *Advertise your MSME:* A dedicated space for women-run MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) to list job vacancies for other women and advertise their products directly on the platform's marketplace.

*   *Job Portal:* An extensive and verified list of job opportunities, providing women with a secure platform to find employment.

*   *Education and Documentation:* A learning hub containing free educational resources to sharpen skills. It also provides clear, step-by-step information on obtaining essential documents like an Aadhar card, PAN card, and Passport.

*   *Be Vocal for Local:* A unique platform where MSMEs can hire local women to act as representatives and promoters for their products, increasing credibility and providing women with incentives and credits.

*   *Latest Schemes:* A centralized information center that provides up-to-date details on the latest beneficial schemes from both government and private sectors.

### Interactive Elements

*   *Sahayika Chatbot:* A friendly chatbot assistant available on every page to help users navigate the site, answer questions, and get instant support.
*   *Responsive Search:* A functional search bar that allows users to instantly find and highlight any term or service on the page.
*   *Google Translate:* A fully integrated Google Translate button in the header allows users to instantly translate the entire website into their preferred language, ensuring maximum accessibility.
*   *Animated UI:* The navigation bar intelligently hides when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up, creating a modern and seamless user experience.
